# esp32-prototype-board

EAGLE schematic for prototype board with 12V power input and all essentials

## TODO for V3

* Shrink to fit into 8cm eletrical box
* Use ESP-Prog as programming and debugging interface vita 1.27mm connectors (no need to handle RTS/DTR signals this way)
* Add led for signaling WPS, possibly even separate button (both needs custom FW support)
